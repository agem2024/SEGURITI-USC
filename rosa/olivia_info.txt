detección y tratamiento. Nuestro objetivo es proporcionar a todos nuestros pacientes la mejor atención. 
Le recomendamos que dedique tiempo a su salud. Para programar una cita hoy mismo, haga clic en My Doctor Online ,

Creatinine 0.60 <=1.11 mg/dL — MWS
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate >60 >=60 mL/min/1.73 
m2— MWS
Comment: 
Estimated GFR (eGFR) helps us know how the kidneys are working. eGFR is based
on the creatinine blood test result, age, sex, and body size. Monitoring eGFR
over time helps us understand changes in kidney function.
Actual kidney function may be better or worse than the estimated GFR because
blood creatinine levels are affected by body make up, diet, hydration,
genetics, and more.
Multiple eGFR values are used to determine chronic kidney disease (CKD)
stages, defined by the following ranges:
eGFR 45 - 59 = Stage 3a
eGFR 30 - 44 = Stage 3b
eGFR 15 - 29 = Stage 4
eGFR under 15 = Stage 5
Values for eGFR before 05/25/2022 will appear in lab results under "Past
results".

El resultado de su última prueba de hemoglobina A1c indica lo siguiente:
Continúa controlada y dentro de la meta, ¡felicitaciones! (menos de 8%). El próximo análisis de sangre es en 
6 meses. 
Es importante que mantengamos un buen control, por lo que debe continuar con el buen trabajo que ha hecho 
hasta ahora con su tratamiento actual de la diabetes y seguir esforzándose para mantener un estilo de vida sano. Si 
tiene dificultad para mantener sus niveles de azúcar en la sangre en el objetivo (por ejemplo, antes de las comidas 
su nivel de azúcar en sangre está continuamente por encima de 160 o por debajo de 80), comuníquese con nuestra 
oficina. 
 
Su presión arterial más reciente es elevada (meta: menos de 140/90), lo que puede provocar un accidente 
cerebrovascular. Programe una cita con nosotros para ver si necesitamos comenzar o ajustar los 
medicamentos para la presión arterial. Puede llame al (408) 363-4401 para reservar sus citas. 
Se debe realizar su examen ocular fotográfico para personas con diabetes. Esta es una fotografía importante 
para evaluar la retinopatía diabética. Llame a la clínica para programar una cita al (408) 972-6570.
Como recordatorio en general, es necesario que los pacientes diabéticos acudan a una revisión anual con su 
proveedor de atención médica primaria, entonces, pida una cita con LILIANA TOMONA YAMASHIRO MD si no le 
ha visto en este año. 
Nos comunicaremos con usted cuando sea el momento de repetir este análisis de sangre. Si tiene preguntas sobre 
medicamentos relacionados con la presión arterial, la diabetes o el colesterol, comuníquese con nuestra oficina.
Para cuidar de su salud, visite kp.org/mydoctor (haga clic en "Español") o descargue la aplicación móvil My Doctor

Dear Olivia  Morales ,
I work closely with Dr. LILIANA TOMONA YAMASHIRO MD and our team of Clinical Pharmacy Specialists, who 
asked that I contact you to schedule a phone appointment to discuss your recent lab results and home readings. 
I have been trying to reach you by phone but have not been successful.  
The phone number(s) I have on file are:
During a review of your medical record I noticed your last blood pressure reading was high. It’s important to 
control blood pressure to stay healthy and lower your risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney problems. 
For most people, a home blood pressure of 134/84 or less is considered at goal.
If you have a home blood pressure monitor, I’d like you to measure your blood pressure 3 times over the next week 
and send the readings to me in an email.
If you don’t already have one, please buy a blood pressure monitor online or at your local Kaiser Permanente Letter by Tran, Lan K. on 12/20/2023

es la principal causa de pérdida de la visión en Estados Unidos, pero el 95 % de estos casos puede evitarse con pruebas de 
detección y tratamiento. Nuestro objetivo es proporcionar a todos nuestros pacientes la mejor atención. 
Le recomendamos que dedique tiempo a su salud. Para programar una cita hoy mismo, haga clic en My Doctor Online ,

During a review of your medical record I noticed we don't have an updated blood pressure reading for you. 
It’s important to control blood pressure to stay healthy and lower your risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney 
problems. 
For most people, a home blood pressure of 134/84 or less is considered at goal.
If you have a home blood pressure monitor, I’d like you to measure your blood pressure 3 times over the next 
week and send the readings to me in an email.
If you don’t already have one, please buy a blood pressure monitor online or at your local Kaiser Permanente 
pharmacy. We recommend purchasing a blood pressure monitor with an UPPER ARM cuff, such as the Omron 
3 Upper Arm Monitor. Wrist or fingertip devices aren’t accurate. Once you have your upper arm blood pressure 
monitor, please see step-by-step instructions on how to take your blood pressure at home:
Video: https://kpdoc.org/bphomevideo 
Handout: https://kpdoc.org/bphome 
Care for your heart health by making lifestyle changes and taking your medications as directed: 
https://kpdoc.org/phase
Please let me know if you have any questions about the blood pressure monitor or how to take your 
measurements at home.

QFT TB GOLD PLUS INTERPRETATION Negative Negative — ARP
Comment: 
Interpretive Data: Quantiferon TB Gold Plus
Interferon gamma release is measured for specimens from each of
the four collection tubes. A qualitative result (Negative,
Positive, or Indeterminate) is based on interpretation of the four
values, NIL, MITOGEN minus NIL (MITOGEN-NIL), TB1 minus NIL
(TB1-NIL), and TB2 minus NIL (TB2-NIL). The NIL value represents
nonspecific reactivity produced by the patient specimen. The
MITOGEN-NIL value serves as the positive control for the patient
specimen, demonstrating successful lymphocyte activity. The
TB1-NIL tube specifically detects CD4+ lymphocyte reactivity,
specifically stimulated by the TB1 antigens. The TB2-NIL tube
detects both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte reactivity, stimulated by
TB2 antigens. An overall Negative result does not completely rule
out TB infection.
A false-positive result in the absence of other clinical evidence
of TB infection is not uncommon. Refer to: Updated Guidelines for
Using Interferon Gamma Release 
Assays to Detect Mycobacterium
tuberculosis Infection --- United States, 2010
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5905a1.htm), for more
information concerning test performance in low-prevalence
populations and use in occupational screening.

m2— MWS
Comment: 
Estimated GFR (eGFR) helps us know how the kidneys are working. eGFR is based
on the creatinine blood test result, age, sex, and body size. Monitoring eGFR
over time helps us understand changes in kidney function.
Actual kidney function may be better or worse than the estimated GFR because
blood creatinine levels are affected by body make up, diet, hydration,
genetics, and more.
Multiple eGFR values are used to determine chronic kidney disease (CKD)
stages, defined by the following ranges:
eGFR 45 - 59 = Stage 3a
eGFR 30 - 44 = Stage 3b
eGFR 15 - 29 = Stage 4
eGFR under 15 = Stage 5
Values for eGFR before 05/25/2022 will appear in lab results under "Past
results".

Dear Ms. Morales,
We are pleased to inform you that review of the images taken recently for your diabetic screening showed only 
minimal diabetic eye disease.  No eye treatment is required.
We recommend that you continue to work with your primary care physician to obtain optimal blood sugar, cholesterol 
and blood pressure control.  Please remember that optimizing blood sugar, cholesterol and blood pressure will help 
you minimize the chance of losing vision from diabetic retinopathy. We recommend repeating the diabetic 
retinopathy screening photos in one year.
In the continuing effort to optimize your eye health, your current photos may be used to monitor for other eye 
conditions. We may contact you if additional screening tests are needed in the future.
Please call your local KP eye department if you have any further questions.  We look forward to a continued 
partnership for good health. Letter by Nguyen, Mai Ngoc (O.D.) on 4/23/2024

specimens from each of
the four collection tubes. A qualitative result 
(Negative,
Positive, or Indeterminate) is based on 
interpretation of the four
values, NIL, MITOGEN minus NIL 
(MITOGEN-NIL), TB1 minus NIL
(TB1-NIL), and TB2 minus NIL (TB2-NIL). 
The NIL value represents
nonspecific reactivity produced by the 
patient specimen. The
MITOGEN-NIL value serves as the positive 
control for the patient
specimen, demonstrating successful 
lymphocyte activity. The
TB1-NIL tube specifically detects CD4+ 
lymphocyte reactivity,
specifically stimulated by the TB1 antigens. 
The TB2-NIL tube
detects both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte 
reactivity, stimulated by
TB2 antigens. An overall Negative result 
does not completely rule
out TB infection.
A false-positive result in the absence of 
other clinical evidence
of TB infection is not uncommon. Refer to:

Using Interferon Gamma Release Assays to

Hi Olivia
Attached is the diet that we give to our rheumatoid arthritis patients. In general, it is a diet that may help reduce 
inflammations of the joints.  The recommended supplements are listed below. 
Supplements:
Vit D 1000-2000IU/day-regulate immune system
Omega-3 2000mg/day-reduce inflammation
Tumeric or Ginger capsules-per manufacture instruction-reduce inflammation
You may copy and paste the link below to go onto the arthritis foundation website to check for the anti-
inflammatory diet.  When you are on the web site, you can click on the pictures and the words will come below 
the pictures and give you the explanation.
https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/nutrition/anti-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory-diet
You may call the number below to set up an appointment with me if you would like to talk to me directly or have

Comment: 
Estimated GFR (eGFR) helps us know how the kidneys are working. eGFR is based
on the creatinine blood test result, age, sex, and body size. Monitoring eGFR
over time helps us understand changes in kidney function.
Actual kidney function may be better or worse than the estimated GFR because
blood creatinine levels are affected by body make up, diet, hydration,
genetics, and more.
Multiple eGFR values are used to determine chronic kidney disease (CKD)
stages, defined by the following ranges:
eGFR 45 - 59 = Stage 3a
eGFR 30 - 44 = Stage 3b
eGFR 15 - 29 = Stage 4
eGFR under 15 = Stage 5

Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate >60 mL/min/1.73 m2>=60 mL/min/1.73 m2
Estimated GFR (eGFR) helps us know how 
the kidneys are working. eGFR is based
on the creatinine blood test result, age, sex, 
and body size. Monitoring eGFR
over time helps us understand changes in 
kidney function.
Actual kidney function may be better or 
worse than the estimated GFR because
blood creatinine levels are affected by body 
make up, diet, hydration,
genetics, and more.
Multiple eGFR values are used to 
determine chronic kidney disease (CKD)
stages, defined by the following ranges:
eGFR 45 - 59 = Stage 3a
eGFR 30 - 44 = Stage 3b
eGFR 15 - 29 = Stage 4
eGFR under 15 = Stage 5
Values for eGFR before 05/25/2022 will 
appear in lab results under "Past
results".

Test Name Explanation
ERYTHROCYTE 
SEDIMENTATION RATE (ESR)The Sed Rate is a nonspecific test of inflammation in the body..
Creatinine Kidney (Creatinine) measures how well the kidneys filter wastes from the 
blood.
Estimated Glomerular Filtration 
RateKidneyFunction-GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) estimates your current 
kidney function based on your age and race.  Normal values are greater than 
59.  Repeated values between 30 and 59 usually mean that kidney function 
is below normal (stage 3 chronic kidney disease).  People over 65 often 
have values in this range. Values between 15 and 29 usually mean that 
kidney function is far below normal (stage 4 chronic kidney disease). Values 
less than 15 usually mean that kidney function is severely below normal 
(stage 5 chronic kidney disease).  Medical treatment and follow-up testing is 
recommended for people with a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease.
ALT Liver test (ALT) tests for liver inflammation.
C-reactive protein,ser,ql
Generated on 11/23/25  8:20 PMC Reac Protein is a nonspecific measure of inflammation.

Filtration RateFunción renal: La tasa de filtración glomerular (glomerular filtration 
rate, GFR) permite calcular la función renal actual según la edad y 
la raza.  Los valores normales son superiores a 59.  Obtener valores 
de entre 30 y 59 reiteradas veces, por lo general, significa que la 
función renal está por debajo de lo normal (enfermedad renal 
crónica en etapa 3).
A menudo, las personas mayores de 65 años tienen valores dentro 
de este rango. Los valores de entre 15 y 29 generalmente indican 
que la función renal está muy por debajo de lo normal (enfermedad 
renal crónica en etapa 4). Los valores inferiores a 15, por lo general, 
indican que la función renal está excesivamente por debajo de lo 
normal (enfermedad renal crónica en etapa 5).
Se recomienda que las personas con un diagnóstico de enfermedad 
renal crónica reciban tratamiento médico y se hagan pruebas de 
seguimiento.
ALT La prueba del hígado (alanina aminotransferasa, ALT) permite 
detectar la inflamación del hígado.
C-reactive protein,ser,ql La proteína C reactiva es un indicador no específico de inflamación.
Uric acid La prueba de ácido úrico mide un producto de degradación de las 
proteínas en la sangre.  Los niveles altos pueden provocar gota.
WBC COUNT La prueba de glóbulos blancos mide el nivel de glóbulos blancos en 
la sangre.
Red blood cells count La prueba de glóbulos rojos mide la cantidad total de glóbulos rojos 
en la sangre.
Hgb La hemoglobina es una prueba que mide los niveles de la proteína 
de los glóbulos rojos que transporta el oxígeno.
Hematocrit La prueba de hematocrito permite detectar la anemia.
MCV La prueba de volumen corpuscular medio (mean corpuscular 
volume , MCV) se hace para medir el tamaño de los glóbulos rojos.

Vitamin B12 595 >=301 pg/mL — MWS
Comment: 
Vitamin B12 is a nutrient that keeps red blood cells and nerve cells healthy.
Having low levels of vitamin B12 can lead to anemia, nerve damage, and
problems with memory and thinking.
Many things can cause low levels of vitamin B12, including:
         1. Not getting enough of this vitamin through food
         2. Long-term use of certain medications, such as metformin and
             acid-reducing medications
         3. Bariatric surgery: B12 levels >500 pg/mL are optimal
         4. Pernicious anemia, a relatively rare autoimmune disorder
The following are ranges for vitamin B12 levels (pg/mL):
         Normal:              Above 300
         Borderline:          200-300
         Low:                 Below 200

INTERPRETIVE INFORMATION: Vitamin B1, Whole Blood
This assay measures the concentration of thiamine diphosphate
(TDP), the primary active form of vitamin B1. Approximately 90
percent of vitamin B1 present in whole blood is TDP. Thiamine and
thiamine monophosphate, which comprise the remaining 10 percent,
are not measured.
This test was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by ARUP Laboratories. It has not been cleared or
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. This test was
performed in a CLIA certified laboratory and is intended for

Creatinine 0.64 <=1.11 mg/dL — MWS
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate >60 >=60 mL/min/1.73 
m2— MWS
Comment: 
Estimated GFR (eGFR) helps us know how the kidneys are working. eGFR is based
on the creatinine blood test result, age, sex, and body size. Monitoring eGFR
over time helps us understand changes in kidney function.
Actual kidney function may be better or worse than the estimated GFR because
blood creatinine levels are affected by body make up, diet, hydration,
genetics, and more.
Multiple eGFR values are used to determine chronic kidney disease (CKD)
stages, defined by the following ranges:
eGFR 45 - 59 = Stage 3a
eGFR 30 - 44 = Stage 3b
eGFR 15 - 29 = Stage 4
eGFR under 15 = Stage 5
Values for eGFR before 05/25/2022 will appear in lab results under "Past
results".

Hola Sra. Olivia M Morales:
Soy la especialista en diabetes que colabora con su proveedor de atención médica primaria, LILIANA TOMONA 
YAMASHIRO MD.
Gracias por hacerse su prueba de laboratorio de A1C. La A1C es una prueba de sangre que ayuda a medir sus 
niveles de azúcar en la sangre a lo largo de los últimos 2 a 3 meses. A la mayoría de las personas con diabetes 
se les pedirá hacerse una prueba de A1C cada 3 a 6 meses.
Su objetivo de A1C cuando tiene diabetes es de menos de 8%.

Ahora está en la meta. Excelente, ¡felicitaciones! El próximo análisis de sangre es en 6 meses. 
Los resultados de su prueba muestran que su A1C está en un rango saludable. Buen trabajo, ¡siga así! 
Recuerde evitar tener demasiadas lecturas de un nivel bajo de azúcar en la sangre.  
Es importante que MANTENGAMOS UN BUEN control, por lo que debe continuar con el buen trabajo que ha 
hecho hasta ahora con su tratamiento actual de la diabetes y seguir esforzándose para mantener un estilo de 
vida sano. Si tiene dificultad para mantener sus niveles de azúcar en la sangre en el objetivo (por ejemplo, 
antes de las comidas su nivel de azúcar en sangre está continuamente por encima de 160 o por debajo de 80), 
comuníquese con nuestra oficina. 
Las metas para el nivel azúcar en la sangre:
Siga estas recomendaciones para mantener su diabetes bien controlada: 
•Tome sus medicamentos para la diabetes como le hayan indicado. Lea más sobre la manera como los 
medicamentos ayudan a mantener bajo control sus niveles de azúcar en la sangre.
•Tome regularmente su medicamento de estatinas (si se lo recetaron). Las investigaciones demuestran

Hola Sra. Olivia M Morales:
Soy la especialista en diabetes que colabora con su proveedor de atención médica primaria, LILIANA TOMONA 
YAMASHIRO MD.
Gracias por hacerse su prueba de laboratorio de A1C. La A1C es una prueba de sangre que ayuda a medir sus 
niveles de azúcar en la sangre a lo largo de los últimos 2 a 3 meses. A la mayoría de las personas con diabetes se 
les pedirá hacerse una prueba de A1C cada 3 a 6 meses.
Su objetivo de A1C cuando tiene diabetes es de menos de 8%. 
El último resultado de su prueba de A1C: 
Ahora está en la meta. Excelente, ¡felicitaciones! El próximo análisis de sangre es en 3-6 meses (Enero 2025). 
Los resultados de su prueba muestran que su A1C está en un rango saludable. Buen trabajo, ¡siga así! Recuerde 
evitar tener demasiadas lecturas de un nivel bajo de azúcar en la sangre.  
Es importante que MANTENGAMOS UN BUEN control, por lo que debe continuar con el buen trabajo que ha hecho 
hasta ahora con su tratamiento actual de la diabetes y seguir esforzándose para mantener un estilo de vida sano. Si 
tiene dificultad para mantener sus niveles de azúcar en la sangre en el objetivo (por ejemplo, antes de las comidas 
su nivel de azúcar en sangre está continuamente por encima de 160 o por debajo de 80), comuníquese con nuestra 
oficina.

Siga estas recomendaciones para mantener su diabetes bien controlada: 
•Tome sus medicamentos para la diabetes como le hayan indicado.  
•Tome regularmente su medicamento de estatinas (si se lo recetaron). Las investigaciones demuestran que 
un uso regular de estatinas reducirá considerablemente su riesgo de ataque cardíaco o cerebral, y puede 
prolongar su vida.   
•Hágase revisiones de rutina, incluyendo la de los ojos para retinopatía diabética y la de su presión 
arterial. Infórmese más sobre cómo las revisiones regulares pueden ayudarle a prevenir complicaciones de la 
diabetes.
•Monitoree su nivel de azúcar en la sangre desde su hogar con el medidor OneTouch Verio Flex. Esta es 
una excelente manera de asegurarse de que está manteniéndose en su rango objetivo o para saber 
oportunamente si está comenzando a salirse de este.
•Revise nuestro sitio web Cómo vivir bien con diabetes para obtener más información sobre la alimentación 
saludable, el ejercicio, el manejo del estrés, el cuidado de su salud emocional y más.
•Asista a nuestras clases de educación sobre la diabetes. 
 
Como recordatorio en general, es necesario que los pacientes diabéticos acudan a una revisión anual con su 
proveedor de atención médica primaria, entonces, pida una cita con LILIANA TOMONA YAMASHIRO MD si no le 
ha visto en este año.

Comment: 
Estimated GFR (eGFR) helps us know how the kidneys are working. eGFR is based
on the creatinine blood test result, age, sex, and body size. Monitoring eGFR
over time helps us understand changes in kidney function.
Actual kidney function may be better or worse than the estimated GFR because
blood creatinine levels are affected by body make up, diet, hydration,
genetics, and more.
Multiple eGFR values are used to determine chronic kidney disease (CKD)
stages, defined by the following ranges:
eGFR 45 - 59 = Stage 3a
eGFR 30 - 44 = Stage 3b
eGFR 15 - 29 = Stage 4
eGFR under 15 = Stage 5
Values for eGFR before 05/25/2022 will appear in lab results under "Past
results".

Comment: 
Urine Albumin/Creatinine ratio (UACR) helps us to know how the kidneys are
working. Albumin in the urine is a sensitive test to measure protein in the
urine and may indicate early kidney disease. This test along with the
estimated GFR can help determine risk of kidney disease progression.
Based on the result, UACR (mg/g) will be followed over time by your medical
team.
<30: Normal
30-300: Moderately Increased
>300: Severely Increased
If severely increased, additional tests will be automatically completed to
learn more about how the kidneys are working.

Dear Ms. Morales,
I am one of the clinical pharmacists working with your Rheumatology Team.  I have reviewed your 
recent lab work.  
-ESR (nonspecific inflammation test) - normal.
-CRP (another nonspecific inflammation test) - normal.
-creatinine (kidney test) - normal.
-ALT (liver test) - normal.
-CBC (blood cell count) - stable compared to past fluctuations.
Please continue your current treatment plan.
Please let us know if you have questions or concerns regarding your blood tests.

Estimada Sra. Olivia M Morales:
Soy la especialista en diabetes que colabora con su proveedor de atención médica primaria, LILIANA TOMONA 
YAMASHIRO MD.
Gracias por hacerse su prueba de laboratorio de A1C. La A1C es una prueba de sangre que ayuda a medir sus

Los resultados de su prueba muestran que su A1C está en un rango saludable. Buen trabajo, ¡siga así! 
Recuerde evitar tener demasiadas lecturas de un nivel bajo de azúcar en la sangre.  
 
Las metas para el nivel azúcar en la sangre:
Siga estas recomendaciones para mantener su diabetes bien controlada: 
•Tome sus medicamentos para la diabetes como le hayan indicado. Lea más sobre la manera como los 
medicamentos ayudan a mantener bajo control sus niveles de azúcar en la sangre.
•Tome regularmente su medicamento de estatinas (si se lo recetaron). Las investigaciones demuestran 
que un uso regular de estatinas reducirá considerablemente su riesgo de ataque cardíaco o cerebral, y 
puede prolongar su vida. Vea esta serie de videos (en inglés) que muestran las historias de pacientes 
reales y responden algunas preguntas frecuentes sobre las estatinas. 
•Hágase revisiones de rutina, incluyendo la de los ojos para retinopatía diabética y la de su presión 
arterial. Infórmese más sobre cómo las revisiones regulares pueden ayudarle a prevenir complicaciones de 
la diabetes.
•Monitoree su nivel de azúcar en la sangre desde su hogar con el medidor OneTouch Verio Flex. Esta 
es una excelente manera de asegurarse de que está manteniéndose en su rango objetivo o para saber

alimentación saludable, el ejercicio, el manejo del estrés, el cuidado de su salud emocional y más.
•Asista a nuestras clases de educación sobre la diabetes. 
Al revisar su historia clínica, me di cuenta de que no tenemos una lectura actualizada de su presión 
arterial. Es importante controlar su presión arterial para mantenerse saludable y reducir su riesgo de un ataque 
cardíaco, cerebral y problemas renales (del riñón). 
Para la mayoría de las personas, se considera una meta tener una presión arterial en casa de 134/84 o menos. 
Si tiene un monitor de presión arterial, me gustaría que se midiera la presión arterial 3 veces esta semana que 
viene y que me envíe las lecturas por medio de un correo electrónico. 
Si aún no tiene uno, sírvase comprar un monitor de presión arterial en línea o en su farmacia local de Kaiser 
Permanente. Recomendamos comprarse un monitor de presión arterial con un brazalete para la parte 
SUPERIOR del BRAZO, como el Omron 3 Upper Arm Monitor. No son precisos los dispositivos que se colocan 
en la muñeca o en la punta del dedo. Cuando ya tenga su monitor de presión arterial, vea las instrucciones 
paso a paso sobre cómo medirse su presión arterial en casa:

indicado. https://kpdoc.org/phase (en inglés)
Comuníquese conmigo si tiene cualquier pregunta sobre el monitor de presión arterial o sobre cómo tomarse 
sus lecturas en casa.
Si prefiere venir a nuestro centro médico, haga clic aquí o llame al 408-362-4791 para programar una revisión 
de rutina de su presión arterial.
 
Como recordatorio en general, es necesario que los pacientes diabéticos acudan a una revisión anual con su 
proveedor de atención médica primaria, entonces, pida una cita con LILIANA TOMONA YAMASHIRO MD si no 
le ha visto en este año. 
Nos comunicaremos con usted cuando sea el momento de repetir este análisis de sangre. Si tiene preguntas 
sobre medicamentos relacionados con la presión arterial, la diabetes o el colesterol, comuníquese con nuestra 
oficina.BP Readings from Last 3 Encounters:

Dear Olivia M Morales:
In order to gather more information so I can optimally help you, would you kindly fill out this 
questionnaire about your skin concern and send photos if you are able or If you have not done?. I have 
provided instructions on how to take photos below. 
1.-Duration of skin lesion  (days/wks/months/yrs): 
2.-Body location(s), be specific: 
3.-Symptoms (be specific: itching, painful, bleeding, oozing, none): 
4.-Past treatments done and duration: 
5.-Current treatment: 
6.-Any relevant history (URI, meds, exposures, stress, travel, etc): 
7.-Comes and goes or stays? 
8.-What helps it or makes it worse? 
9.-History of similar skin problems  in the past? 
10.-History of atopy or allergies ?
11,- Recent change in colors ?
12.- Recent change in size or shape? Be especific: 
13.- Personal or family history of skin cancer: 
How to email photos to your doctor ( needs high quality photos), please follow these instructions: 
1.Take photos in a brightly lit room or in daylight to avoid shadows. Avoid using flash.
2.Please do not send "selfies." Ask someone else to take the photos of your skin. 
3.Check carefully to make sure all of your photos are in very good focus.
If you are using autofocus, wait until the camera has focused on the image (can be several 
seconds for iPhone). Hold camera steady with two hands to prevent shaking while taking the 
photo.  Also (for iPhone), you can tap the screen over the area of interest to help it focus.

4.Point the phone or camera directly at the area of concern. 
5.Take at least 2 photos, one about 3 to 6 feet away (distance) and one 4 to 6 inches away (close 
up). 
6.If it is a rash, also take at least one or two photos from far enough away to showing all the areas 
of involvement. For rashes on the hands or feet, take photos that show both sides of both hands 
and/or both feet (including fingernails and toenails).
7.For growths or spots, draw a dot on either side of a growth with a pen or marker before taking 
the photos. 
8.Double check for focus and quality prior to sending the photos to us and retake as needed.

Hi Lan,
Pt FTKA. Can you please help reschedule the 30 min TAV? Tried calling x3 but no answer and call 
was declined so I was not able to leave a message. Please let me know if you have trouble reaching 
pt or please add to tech escalation list if unable to reach x3.
Can you also let pt know they are due for BP check, statin refill, and DM retinopathy screening?
Thanks!

Dear Ms. Morales,
We are pleased to inform you that review of the images taken recently for your diabetic screening did not 
demonstrate any diabetic eye disease.
We recommend that you continue to work with your primary care physician to obtain optimal blood sugar, cholesterol 
and blood pressure control.  Please remember that optimizing blood sugar, cholesterol and blood pressure will help 
you minimize the chance of losing vision from diabetic retinopathy. We recommend repeating the diabetic

detección y tratamiento. Nuestro objetivo es proporcionar a todos nuestros pacientes la mejor atención.

Dear Ms. Morales,
I am one of the clinical pharmacists working with your Rheumatology Team.  I have reviewed your 
recent lab work.
All of the following labs were normal/stable:
-ESR (nonspecific inflammation test) 
-CBC (blood cell count) 
We are still waiting for the results of your Tuberculosis screening and CRP (another nonspecific 
inflammation test) and will let you know if there are any concerns.
Please continue your current treatment plan.
Please let us know if you have questions or concerns regarding your blood tests. 
Warm regards,
Bernadette Cirit, PharmD (on behalf of Dr. Lin)

CREATININE W GFR, CALCULATED [8757523846] Resulted: 08/13/25 0958, Result status: In processComponents  
Component Value Reference RangeFlag Lab
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate >60 >=60 mL/min/1.73 
m2— MWS
Comment: 
Estimated GFR (eGFR) helps us know how the kidneys are working. eGFR is based
on the creatinine blood test result, age, sex, and body size. Monitoring eGFR
over time helps us understand changes in kidney function.
Actual kidney function may be better or worse than the estimated GFR because
blood creatinine levels are affected by body make up, diet, hydration,
genetics, and more.
Multiple eGFR values are used to determine chronic kidney disease (CKD)
stages, defined by the following ranges:
eGFR 45 - 59 = Stage 3a
eGFR 30 - 44 = Stage 3b
eGFR 15 - 29 = Stage 4
eGFR under 15 = Stage 5
Values for eGFR before 05/25/2022 will appear in lab results under "Past
results".

QFT TB GOLD PLUS INTERPRETATION NEGATIVE NEGATIVE — BER
Comment: 
The QuantiFERON Gold is an “Interferon gamma release assay” (IGRA) which tests
immune response indicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection using four
values: NIL, Mitogen–NIL, TB1-NIL and TB2-NIL. The NIL value is the patient’s
baseline interferon concentration. The Mitogen-NIL value is used as a positive
control for the individual’s immune status, correct blood handling, and test
incubation. The TB1-Nil value tests patient CD4+ lymphocyte response to TB1
antigens, and the TB2-NIL value tests patient CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte
response to TB2 antigens.
_______________________________________________________________________
•A positive result suggests infection with M. tuberculosis. Further evaluation
is needed to differentiate between latent TB infection (LTBI) and TB disease.
Patients with LTBI should be treated to prevent progression to TB disease.
•A negative result suggests M. tuberculosis infection is unlikely.
•An indeterminate result means that likelihood of M. 
tuberculosis infection
could not be determined. A single repeat on a new sample is advised.

Tomona Yamashiro, Liliana (M.D.) on 8/14/2025  8:35 PMUrine Albumin/Creatinine ratio (UACR) helps us to know how the kidneys are
working. Albumin in the urine is a sensitive test to measure protein in the
urine and may indicate early kidney disease. This test along with the
estimated GFR can help determine risk of kidney disease progression.
Based on the result, UACR (mg/g) will be followed over time by your medical
team.
<30: Normal
30-300: Moderately Increased
>300: Severely Increased
If severely increased, additional tests will be automatically completed to
learn more about how the kidneys are working.

Gracias por hacerse su prueba de laboratorio de A1C. La A1C es una prueba de sangre que ayuda a medir sus 
niveles de azúcar en la sangre a lo largo de los últimos 2 a 3 meses. A la mayoría de las personas con diabetes 
se les pedirá hacerse una prueba de A1C cada 3 a 6 meses.
 
El último resultado de su prueba de A1C: 
Continúa controlada y dentro de la meta de 7%, ¡felicitaciones! El próximo análisis de sangre es en 6 
meses. Revision History

Los resultados de su prueba muestran que su A1C está en un rango saludable. Buen trabajo, ¡siga así! 
Recuerde evitar tener demasiadas lecturas de un nivel bajo de azúcar en la sangre.  
Es importante que MANTENGAMOS UN BUEN control, por lo que debe continuar con el buen trabajo que ha 
hecho hasta ahora con su tratamiento actual de la diabetes y seguir esforzándose para mantener un estilo de 
vida sano. Si tiene dificultad para mantener sus niveles de azúcar en la sangre en el objetivo (por ejemplo, 
antes de las comidas su nivel de azúcar en sangre está continuamente por encima de 160 o por debajo de 80), 
comuníquese con nuestra oficina. 
Las metas para el nivel azúcar en la sangre:
Siga estas recomendaciones para mantener su diabetes bien controlada: 
•Tome sus medicamentos para la diabetes como le hayan indicado. Lea más sobre la manera como los 
medicamentos ayudan a mantener bajo control sus niveles de azúcar en la sangre.
•Tome regularmente su medicamento de estatinas (si se lo recetaron). Las investigaciones demuestran 
que un uso regular de estatinas reducirá considerablemente su riesgo de ataque cardíaco o cerebral, y 
puede prolongar su vida. Vea esta serie de videos (en inglés) que muestran las historias de pacientes

reales y responden algunas preguntas frecuentes sobre las estatinas. 
•Hágase revisiones de rutina, incluyendo la de los ojos para retinopatía diabética y la de su presión 
arterial. Infórmese más sobre cómo las revisiones regulares pueden ayudarle a prevenir complicaciones de 
la diabetes.
•Monitoree su nivel de azúcar en la sangre desde su hogar con el medidor OneTouch Verio Flex. Esta 
es una excelente manera de asegurarse de que está manteniéndose en su rango objetivo o para saber 
oportunamente si está comenzando a salirse de este.
•Revise nuestro sitio web Cómo vivir bien con diabetes para obtener más información sobre la 
alimentación saludable, el ejercicio, el manejo del estrés, el cuidado de su salud emocional y más.
•Asista a nuestras clases de educación sobre la diabetes. 
Como recordatorio en general, es necesario que los pacientes diabéticos acudan a una revisión anual 
con su proveedor de atención médica primaria, entonces, pida una cita con LILIANA TOMONA 
YAMASHIRO MD si no le ha visto en este año. 
Le toca tomar su importante medicamento para el corazón (atorvastatina, rosuvastatina o simvastatina, 
etc.), que ayuda a prevenir ataques cardíacos y accidentes cerebrovasculares. Independientemente de 
sus niveles de azúcar y colesterol en sangre, se ha demostrado clínicamente que este medicamento ayuda a 
prevenir ataques cardíacos y accidentes cerebrovasculares en pacientes con diabetes mayores de 40 años. 
Puede resurtir este medicamento a través de la aplicación MyDoctorOnline, en kp.org o llamando a su farmacia 
Kaiser preferida. No lo suspenda sin consultar a su médico. Informe a su médico sobre cualquier efecto 
secundario para obtener opciones alternativas. Regístrese para recibir recordatorios de resurtido y resurtido 
automático (¡NUEVO!).
Nos comunicaremos con usted cuando sea el momento de repetir este análisis de sangre. Si tiene preguntas 
sobre medicamentos relacionados con la presión arterial, la diabetes o el colesterol, comuníquese con nuestra 
oficina.
Para cuidar de su salud, visite kp.org/mydoctor (haga clic en "Español") o descargue la aplicación móvil My 
Doctor Online para programar citas de manera fácil, solicitar que se vuelvan a surtir sus medicamentos, ver

Tienes que tener paciencia, la muestra esta procesandose y como te mencione los cultivos demoran 
en traer resultados entre 4-6 semanas, el dermatologo sugiere que esperes si sale positivo para 
hongos recibiras antibioticos si es negativo ellos te quieren evaluar en persona, pero tenemos que 
esperar.

Dear Olivia
 
I am one of the clinical pharmacists working with your Rheumatology Team.  I have reviewed your 
recent lab work.
 
All of the following labs were normal/stable:
ESR (nonspecific inflammation test)
CBC (blood cell count)
We are still waiting on results of Inflammation test (CRP), Kidney tests, and Liver tests which can take 
a couple days and is still in process - we'll let you know if this comes back abnormal.
 
Please let us know if you have questions or concerns regarding your blood tests. 
 
 
Warm regards,
Hien Pham, PharmD

Comment: 
Estimated GFR (eGFR) helps us know how the kidneys are working. eGFR is based
on the creatinine blood test result, age, sex, and body size. Monitoring eGFR
over time helps us understand changes in kidney function.
Actual kidney function may be better or worse than the estimated GFR because
blood creatinine levels are affected by body make up, diet, hydration,
genetics, and more.
Multiple eGFR values are used to determine chronic kidney disease (CKD)
stages, defined by the following ranges:
eGFR 45 - 59 = Stage 3a
eGFR 30 - 44 = Stage 3b
eGFR 15 - 29 = Stage 4
eGFR under 15 = Stage 5
Values for eGFR before 05/25/2022 will appear in lab results under "Past
