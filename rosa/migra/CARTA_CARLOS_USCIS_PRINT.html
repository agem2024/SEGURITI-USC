            <strong>Subject: Letter of Intent to Support and Sponsor ALEX GIOVANNI ESPINOSA MORALES</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="salutation">Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>I am writing this letter to confirm my role as a moral and social sponsor for <strong>ALEX GIOVANNI ESPINOSA
                MORALES</strong> in connection with his application for a waiver of unlawful presence.</p>

        <p>I am <strong>CARLOS IDELFONSO MURIAS SANDOVAL</strong>, a <strong>United States Citizen</strong> residing in
            the United States. I have known ALEX GIOVANNI ESPINOSA MORALES for <strong>35 years</strong> as his
            <strong>stepfather</strong>. Alex has been my stepson since I married his mother, Olivia Morales Montoya,
            and I have watched him grow into the dedicated, hardworking, and honest man he is today.</p>

        <p>I attest that Alex is a person of <strong>high integrity, diligence, and strong moral character</strong>.
            Throughout our 35+ years of family relationship, he has consistently demonstrated responsibility, respect
            for others, and unwavering commitment to his family.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>My Commitment to Alex</h2>

        <ol class="commitment-list">
            <li>
                <span class="commitment-title">Social and Emotional Support:</span> I am committed to assisting Alex as
                he proceeds through the legal immigration process. I will provide ongoing encouragement and moral
                support to him and his family. As the head of our household, I welcome Alex's continued presence in our
                home and family life.
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="commitment-title">Community Integration:</span> I will actively help Alex with his
                continued integration into the community, including assisting with accessing community services,
                professional networking for his plumbing business, and maintaining strong family and community ties that
                he has built over the past 10 years in San Jose, California.
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="commitment-title">Financial Intention:</span> While I understand that this letter does not
                replace the official Affidavit of Support (Form I-864), I confirm my personal willingness and ability to
                provide temporary financial assistance, if necessary, to ensure Alex and our family remain stable and
                self-sufficient upon the approval of the waiver.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why Alex's Presence Is Essential</h2>

        <p>Alex is not merely a stepson to me; he is the son I have known and loved for over three decades. His presence
            in our household is <strong>essential</strong> for the following reasons:</p>

        <p><strong>Care for My Wife:</strong> My wife, Olivia Morales Montoya (Lawful Permanent Resident), suffers from
            <strong>11 chronic medical conditions</strong> including Type 2 Diabetes, Hypertension, Hypothyroidism,
            Osteoporosis, GERD, Neuropathy, and others. She takes <strong>12 daily medications</strong> and requires
            constant supervision. At my age of <strong>69 years</strong>, I cannot provide all the care she needs alone.
            Alex is her primary caregiver, managing her medications, driving her to medical appointments, and
            translating for her with doctors (she speaks only Spanish).</p>

        <p><strong>Family Stability:</strong> Alex provides stability to our entire family unit. He contributes
            financially to our household, helps maintain our home, and serves as a pillar of support for me, my wife,
            and his siblings.</p>

        <p><strong>Preventing Extreme Hardship:</strong> If Alex is forced to leave the United States, my wife's health
            will deteriorate rapidly. I would be unable to care for her alone, and professional home care would cost
            $3,000-$6,000 monthly, which we cannot afford. This would cause extreme emotional, physical, and financial
            hardship to our entire family.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>I firmly believe that Alex deserves this opportunity to formalize his immigration status and continue his
            positive contributions to the United States. He has been a law-abiding, hardworking member of our community
            for nearly a decade. He has never been arrested, pays his taxes faithfully, and contributes to the local
            economy through his professional plumbing services.</p>

        <p><strong>I urge you to approve his waiver request.</strong></p>
