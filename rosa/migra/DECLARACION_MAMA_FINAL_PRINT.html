            RE: Personal Declaration of Extreme Hardship<br>
            In the Matter of: ALEX GIOVANNI ESPINOSA MORALES<br>
            Qualifying Relative: OLIVIA MORALES MONTOYA (Mother, LPR)
        </div>

        <p>Dear Adjudicating Officer,</p>

        <p>I am <strong>OLIVIA MORALES MONTOYA</strong>, a Lawful Permanent Resident of the United States. I am writing
            to you as the Qualifying Relative/Mother of the applicant, <strong>ALEX GIOVANNI ESPINOSA MORALES</strong>,
            in support of his application for a Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver (I-601A).</p>

        <div class="section-title">1. Nature of Relationship and Dependency</div>

        <p>My relationship with Alex is essential. He is not just my son; he is a critical support system in my daily
            life. For over 10 years, Alex has been an integral part of my household, offering stability that I cannot
            find elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Specifically, I depend on Alex for assistance with my complex medical management. As a 68-year-old woman with
            multiple chronic conditions—including <strong>Type 2 Diabetes (A1C 7.9%), Hypertension, Hypothyroidism, and
                Osteoporosis</strong>—managing my health is a daily challenge.</p>

        <p>My medical history confirms my need for consistent care:</p>
        <div class="list-item">• <strong>Recent Issues:</strong> Evaluations for gastrointestinal pain, abdominal pain,
            and uncontrolled blood pressure (146/79 at last check).</div>
        <div class="list-item">• <strong>Medication Management:</strong> I take over 10 different medications daily,
            including Insulin/Metformin for diabetes, Lisinopril for blood pressure, and Levothyroxine for my thyroid.
        </div>
        <div class="list-item">• <strong>Logistics:</strong> I have had multiple appointments (Lab, Podiatry, Primary
            Care) where Alex's support in coordination or transport is vital.</div>

        <div class="section-title">2. Hardship If I Remain in the U.S. Without My Son</div>

        <p>If this waiver is denied and Alex is forced to leave, I would face <strong>Extreme Hardship</strong> beyond
            the normal pain of separation.</p>

        <p><strong>Medical Hardship:</strong> My physician has documented my chronic conditions. The emotional
            devastation of losing my son would severely impact my physical health. Stress is a known aggravator for both
            Hypertension and Diabetes. Without Alex here to help monitor my condition and support me, I am at high risk
            of rapid health decline.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial Hardship:</strong> My husband, Carlos Idelfonso Murias Sandoval (USC), and I rely heavily
            on Alex.
            Currently, our household expenses are approximately <strong>$6,380 per month</strong> (Rent, Utilities,
            Insurance, Medical).
            Our combined income (my SSI and Carlos's earnings) is only about $3,700.
            <strong>Alex contributes approximately $800-$1,000 monthly</strong> directly to our household, plus he
            covers his own living costs which reduces our burden.
            Without him, we would face a <strong>monthly deficit of over $2,600</strong>. We would likely lose our home
            and be unable to afford my necessary medications and copays ($600/month).
        </p>

        <p><strong>Indirect Hardship to my Spouse:</strong> My husband Carlos is devoted, but he cannot carry this
            burden alone. He works hard, but the stress of being the sole provider and sole caregiver would be
            devastating to our 35+ year marriage and his own well-being.</p>

        <div class="section-title">3. Hardship If I Am Forced to Relocate</div>

        <p>I cannot feasibly relocate to Colombia. Doing so would cause me Extreme Hardship because:</p>

        <p><strong>Abandonment of Status:</strong> I would be forced to abandon my Lawful Permanent Resident status,
            giving up the life and home I have established in the U.S. for over a decade.</p>

        <p><strong>Medical Care:</strong> I require specialized, consistent care for my Diabetes, Heart condition, and
            Osteoporosis. The specific regimen of medications and specialists I have at Kaiser Permanente would be
            difficult, unsafe, or unaffordable to replicate in Colombia at my age.</p>

        <p><strong>Separation from Family:</strong> My husband is a U.S. Citizen. My other children (Susana, Stefanny)
            are U.S. Citizens living here. Relocating would mean separating from my entire immediate family, which would
            cause irreparable damage to my mental health and my marriage.</p>

        <p>I respectfully request that you strongly consider these factors. My life, health, and stability are
            inextricably tied to Alex’s presence here. I ask that you approve this waiver to keep our family together.
        </p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
