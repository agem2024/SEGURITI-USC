        <p><strong>APPLICANT'S PERSONAL STATEMENT</strong></p>
        <p>December 2025</p>
    </div>

    <h2>APPLICANT INFORMATION</h2>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> ALEX GIOVANNI ESPINOSA MORALES<br>
        <strong>Date of Birth:</strong> May 26, 1978<br>
        <strong>Country of Origin:</strong> Colombia<br>
        <strong>Qualifying Relative:</strong> OLIVIA MORALES MONTOYA (Mother - Lawful Permanent Resident)
    </p>

    <h2>MY STORY AND REASONS FOR THIS APPLICATION</h2>

    <p>My name is <strong>Alex Giovanni Espinosa Morales</strong>. I was born on May 26, 1978 in Colombia, where I grew
        up and became a professional. I came to the United States in May 2015 with the dream of working honestly,
        building a stable life, and above all, supporting my mother, who suffers from multiple chronic medical
        conditions that require constant care.</p>

    <p>During the last <strong>9 years and 7 months</strong>, I have lived in San Jose, California, where I have built a
        life dedicated to work, my family, and my community. I have worked continuously as a professional plumber,
        paying my taxes, contributing to the local economy, and being a productive and respectful member of American
        society. I have never had problems with the law, maintain an impeccable record, and have strived every day to
        demonstrate that I deserve the opportunity to remain in this country that I now consider my home.</p>

    <p>I respectfully request this I-601A waiver because I understand that my presence without legal status has been a
        violation of immigration laws. However, I hope to demonstrate through this statement that my separation from the
        United States would cause <strong>extreme hardship</strong> to my mother, OLIVIA MORALES MONTOYA, who is a
        lawful permanent resident and depends completely on my daily care to survive.</p>

    <h2 class="page-break">WHY I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES</h2>

    <p>My decision to emigrate to the United States in 2015 was not impulsive. It was motivated by three fundamental
        reasons:</p>

    <h3>1. Family Reunification</h3>
    <p>My mother, Olivia, had emigrated years before along with my stepfather, Carlos Idelfonso Murias Sandoval (U.S.
        citizen). For more than 35 years, Carlos has been a father figure in my life, giving me the example of a
        hardworking man dedicated to his family. My mother and Carlos encouraged me to come to reunite as a family and
        take advantage of the opportunities that the United States offers.</p>

    <h3>2. My Mother's Health Crisis</h3>
    <p>In 2014, my mother began developing multiple chronic medical conditions that today, in 2025, have grown to eleven
        serious and debilitating diseases. When I came in 2015, my mother already needed support for her daily care.
        Today, ten years later, her dependence on me is absolute and total.</p>

    <h3>3. Professional Opportunity</h3>
    <p>As an Environmental Engineer graduated in 2004 from Universidad Libre Seccional Pereira in Colombia, with
        experience in environmental consulting, I saw in the United States the opportunity to apply my technical
        knowledge in the residential and commercial plumbing field, where there is great demand for qualified
        professionals in California.</p>

    <h2 class="page-break">MY LIFE IN THE UNITED STATES</h2>

    <h3>Work and Economic Contribution</h3>
    <p>Since my arrival in May 2015, I have worked continuously as a <strong>professional plumber</strong> in the San
        Jose, California area. During these <strong>11 years</strong> (2014-2025), I have:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Worked on residential and commercial projects</li>
        <li>Maintained stable employment with annual income of approximately $76,800 ($6,400/month)</li>
        <li>Paid my taxes faithfully every year</li>
        <li>Contributed $800 monthly ($9,600/year) to my mother's household</li>
        <li>Built a professional reputation based on quality work and honesty</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Community Integration</h3>
    <p>During my time in the United States, I have fully integrated into the San Jose community:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Religious Community:</strong> I actively participate in the local Catholic church</li>
        <li><strong>No Criminal Record:</strong> I maintain a completely clean history</li>
        <li><strong>Family Relationships:</strong> Close ties with my citizen/resident sisters (Susana, 41, and
            Stefanny, 27)</li>
        <li><strong>Language:</strong> Completely bilingual (Spanish/English)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="page-break">EXTREME HARDSHIP TO MY MOTHER</h2>

    <p>This is the most important reason for my application. The denial of this waiver would not only affect me, but
        would have <strong>devastating and irreversible consequences</strong> for my mother, who is a 68-year-old lawful
        permanent resident with serious medical conditions.</p>

    <h3>My Mother's Medical Conditions (11 Chronic Diseases)</h3>

    <p>My mother suffers from the following serious and chronic medical conditions:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (uncontrolled)</li>
        <li>Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)</li>
        <li>Hyperlipidemia (High Cholesterol)</li>
        <li>Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 3</li>
        <li>Overweight/Morbid Obesity</li>
        <li>Hypothyroidism</li>
        <li>Depression</li>
        <li>Chronic Pain</li>
        <li>Sleep Disorders</li>
        <li>Vitamin D Deficiency</li>
        <li>Anxiety</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Daily Medications (12 Medications)</h3>

    <p>My mother must take <strong>12 different medications every day</strong>: Metformin, Glipizide, Lisinopril,
        Amlodipine, Atorvastatin, Levothyroxine, Aspirin, Vitamin D3, Omeprazole, Gabapentin, Sertraline, and Vitamin
        B12.</p>

    <h3>My Role as Primary Caregiver</h3>

    <p><strong>I am my mother's only caregiver.</strong> Without me, she cannot survive. My daily responsibilities
        include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Administering and supervising her 12 daily medications</li>
        <li>Monitoring glucose and blood pressure levels</li>
        <li>Taking her to all her medical appointments</li>
        <li>Communicating with her doctors (she only speaks Spanish)</li>
        <li>Helping her with mobility due to obesity and chronic pain</li>
        <li>Preparing all her meals following a diabetic diet</li>
        <li>Contributing $800 monthly ($9,600/year) to household expenses</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="page-break">Impossibility of Care If I Leave</h3>

    <p><strong>My stepfather Carlos CANNOT care for her alone:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cannot manage the complexity of 11 conditions and 12 medications</li>
        <li>The stress would affect his own health</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>My sisters CANNOT assume complete care:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>They have their own families and jobs</li>
        <li>They do not live with my mother</li>
        <li>They cannot provide 24/7 care</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>If I am denied this waiver:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Immediate Medical Deterioration:</strong> Her diabetes will become uncontrolled with risk of
            diabetic coma; blood pressure uncontrolled with risk of heart attack; kidney disease will progress faster
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mental Health Deterioration:</strong> Her depression will severely worsen with risk of suicidal
            thoughts</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Consequences:</strong> Loss of $800/month contribution, reducing household margin from
            $5,120 to $4,320, insufficient for medical emergencies</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="page-break">MY TIES TO THE UNITED STATES</h2>

    <p>I have lived in the United States continuously for <strong>9 years and 7 months</strong>. During this time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>San Jose, California is my home</li>
        <li>My mother (LPR), stepfather (citizen), and 2 sisters (citizens) are here</li>
        <li>I provide guidance and stability to the entire family</li>
        <li>I contribute economically ($76,800/year)</li>
        <li>I actively participate in religious community</li>
        <li>No criminal history</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>WHY I DESERVE THIS WAIVER</h2>

    <p>I respectfully request that I be granted this I-601A waiver for the following reasons:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>I Have Never Been a Burden:</strong> I have worked and paid taxes, never received public assistance
        </li>
        <li><strong>I Pose No Danger:</strong> Completely clean criminal record</li>
        <li><strong>My Family Needs Me:</strong> My mother will die without my care</li>
        <li><strong>I Have Demonstrated Good Moral Character:</strong> 21 years as a dedicated professional</li>
        <li><strong>The United States Is My Home:</strong> All my family is here</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="page-break">COMMITMENT</h2>

    <p>I acknowledge that my presence without legal status has been a violation of immigration laws. I accept complete
        responsibility.</p>

    <p><strong>If I am granted this waiver, I commit to:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Following all legal procedures for adjustment of status</li>
        <li>Cooperating completely with USCIS</li>
        <li>Maintaining my clean record</li>
        <li>Continuing to be a productive member of society</li>
        <li>Never violating immigration laws again</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

    <p>I am not asking for a favor. I am demonstrating that:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>My mother will die</strong> without my care - this is not exaggeration, it is documented medical
            reality</li>
        <li><strong>I have been a productive member</strong> of American society for nearly a decade</li>
        <li><strong>I pose no risk</strong> to this country</li>
        <li><strong>I have deep and irreversible ties</strong> to the United States</li>
        <li><strong>The extreme hardship</strong> to my mother is real and fatal if I am denied this waiver</li>
    </ol>

    <p>My mother, Olivia Morales Montoya, is a lawful permanent resident of this country. She has followed the laws.
        <strong>It is not fair that she pay with her life for my immigration status error.</strong></p>

    <p>Denying me this waiver is a <strong>death sentence</strong> for my 68-year-old mother with 11 serious medical
        conditions.</p>

    <p><strong>I ask for an opportunity</strong> to regularize my situation, to continue caring for my mother, to keep
        contributing to this country that I love and respect, and to demonstrate that I deserve to be here legally.</p>

    <p>I respectfully request that my I-601A waiver be approved.</p>
